#TODO-MERN

This is my first MERN project- Basic and simple TODO applicaion.
This is just a CRUD application. I have not worked on authentication, error handling and other sercurity stuffs.

To run this project, take following steps:
npm install on both frontend and server in order to install all the npm packages required to run the project.

Create and .env file which will have a variable, "MONGO_URI" and assign the connection string of the database.

Have a Wonderful Day.
