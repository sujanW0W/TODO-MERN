# TODO-MERN

This is my first MERN project- Basic and simple TODO applicaion.
This application also has a simple Register/Login system, that makes a user account and log users into the app.

This is just a basic CRUD application. I have worked on simple authentication using JWT(JSON Web Token).

To run this project, take following steps:

1. npm install on both frontend and server in order to install all the npm packages required to run the project.
2. Create a .env file which will have two variables:
    1. "MONGO_URI": assign the connection string of the database(MONGO-DB).
    2. "JWT_SECRET": assign a secret string or key. This string or key is for signing the web token for authentication.

The user must log into the application in order to Add tasks.
The task will be added to the user's account.
The homepage will get all the tasks that are added by the user.

Have a Wonderful Day.
Peace!
